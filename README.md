# miR-RF APPLICATION Description

The miR-RF application is a predictive tool for evaluating pre-miRNAs based on the machine learning algorithm Random Forest. It consists of Python and R scripts designed to process RNAfold Vienna outputs, extract characteristic features, perform machine learning analysis and generate predictions.

### Overview

The miR-RF application is comprised of Python and R scripts:
- **Python Script (Pre-processing):**
  - Extracts features from pre-miRNAs present in RNAfold output files.
  - Converts extracted features into a numerical format and produces an intermediate file for R processing.
  - Input: RNAfold output file.
  - Output: Intermediate file with extracted features.
- **R Script (Machine Learning):**
  - Performs machine learning analysis on the intermediate file generated by the Python script.
  - Generates a text file containing predictions for each pre-miRNA in the input.
  - Input: Intermediate file generated by the Python script.
  - Output: Text file with predictions (2 for YES, 1 for NO) for each pre-miRNA.

### Input Requirements

The application accepts RNAfold output files as input, structured in the following format:
- A file with a header line starting with ">" followed by five subsequent lines for each pre-miRNA. 
For every input string, made by the header line and its sequence, the output is composed by four lines corresponding to:
1. MFE structure, reported within round brackets;
2. Ensemble structure, with energy reported in square brackets;
3. Centroid structure, with its energy and the minimal base-pair distance to all the structures in the thermodynamic ensemble, reported in curly brackets.
4. Frequency of MFE structure in ensemble and ensemble diversity
   
- Multi-FASTA format is also supported.

In order to obtain the appropriate input for miR-RF, you can install RNAfold Vienna package on your machine, by running:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda viennarna
conda install -c "bioconda/label/cf201901" viennarna
RNAfold -p -d2 --noLP --noDP --noPS <input_file> > <output_RNAfold_file>
```

This command creates the <output_RNAfold_file> file, which is the input for miR-RF. 

- The miR-RF application accommodates all types of input file extensions. 
- Important note: since the header cannot contain values separated by "\t", the application converts any "\t" present in the header into a single space " ". 

  For example, from this input:
  
  ```plaintext
  >hsa-let-7a-1  first_example  1
  ```
  to: 
  
  ```plaintext
  >hsa-let-7a-1 first example 1
  ```

  Note: consider that the code only processes and replaces headers presenting the following symbol: "\t". Any other formats will remain in the final output as written in input.  
  
  
### Input Example

Sample input file structure:

```plaintext
>hsa-let-7a-1
UGGGAUGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUAGUUUUAGGGUCACACCCACCACUGGGAGAUAACUAUACAAUCUACUGUCUUUCCUA
(((((.(((((((((((((((((((((.....(((...((((....)))).))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) (-34.20)
{((((.(((((((((((((((((((((.....(((...((({....}))).))))))))))))))))))))))))))))} [-35.18]
(((((.(((((((((((((((((((((.....(((...((((....)))).))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) {-34.20 d=3.42}
 frequency of mfe structure in ensemble 0.203686; ensemble diversity 5.63
...
```

### Output Example

The output file contains each pre-miRNA name and the corresponding prediction:

```plaintext
"miRNA name"       "prediction"
">hsa-let-7a-1"       "2"
```

### Installation

We recommend creating a new directory to neatly store all the requirements for miR-RF. This facilitates a more organized environment for running the application efficiently. 

1. Conda Installation in Command Line:
   - Follow the provided instructions in the 'CONDA installation' file to install Conda on your system in the directory just created.

2. Activating the Conda environment:
   - Once Conda is installed and activated, clone the URL provided, this imports in you machine all the files becessary for miR-RF to work:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_URL>
   ```
   
   The files used by miR-RF are the following:
   - `miR_configuration_file.yml`: conda environment configuration file;
   - `PY_miR_features_extraction.py`: Python script for feature extraction from pre-miRNAs;
   - `make_miR_pred.R`: R script for making predictions using machine learning;
   - `trained_model_new.RDS`: Includes the pre-trained model data necessary for predictions;
   - `miR_application.py`: Executor program coordinating the feature extraction and prediction processes;
  
3. Use `miR_configuration_file.yml` file to configurate an environment suitable for running miR-RF. It contains a specific set of channel configurations and package installations essential for the
     execution of the application.
     
   ```bash
   conda env create -f miR_configuration_file.yml
   ```
   Note: Creating the environment may take some time because Conda downloads and installs all the necessary packages and dependencies.

   - Activate the env by:

   ```bash
   conda activate miR_RF
   ```

4. Running miR-RF application:

   ```bash
   python3 miR_application.py <input_file> <output_file>
   ```
   Replace input_file with the name of the file containing <output_RNAfold_file>. Similarly, replace output_file with the desired name for the prediction results file.

   Example Usage:

   ```bash
   python3 miR_application.py miRNA_sequences.txt predictions_output.txt
   ```
   miRNA_sequences.txt: Example input file containing pre-miRNA data.
   predictions_output.txt: Output file to store the prediction results.

   Ensure that the input file follows the specified format (see Input requirements). Upon executing this command, the `miR_application.py` program will process the input data, execute feature extraction, and 
   generate predictions using the trained model.


7. Example input files:
   
   Use the provided files, called "miRNA_sequences.txt" and "miRNA_mouse_sequences.txt", if needed, in order to obtain and run an input example.
